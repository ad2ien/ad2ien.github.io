What to do when you have an illustration idea and no artistic skill at all : use Stable Diffusion.

<!-- more -->

## The idea üí°

### Facts

- Every collaborative tool legitimately ask its users for an avatar
- I don't really want to see my face everywhere all day long
- I have a couple of ideas for an illustration but no artistic skills whatsoever

__Fortunately__

- [Stable Diffusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_Diffusion) exists!
- There's a github project : <https://github.com/cmdr2/stable-diffusion-ui> that makes it very easy to use.

### The image

There's a very little known animal in the south of France: [a genet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genet_(animal)). They live at night, nobody sees them and I find them very cool. So I wanted an anthropomorphized version of it.

## Tips & tricks to use Stable Diffusion

I reckon there was a intense use of my CPUs for a couple of days. Trying different prompts and settings to try to get it right.

__Some good ideas :__

- Don't hesitate to generate multiple pictures for the same prompt. Then you can use the least worse version as an input for the next batch.
- Use a specific model, trained with the type of images you want to achieve.
- If you have some drawing, painting or graphic skills it'd be much faster to do it by hand.
- It's hard to have both foreground and background right at the same time so I did them separately.

__Here is the result üéâ__

## Things I never managed to get right

- I drink [mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mate_(drink)) and there's no way Stable Diffusion has ever been train with images featuring people from Argentina or Uruguay!
- I drink coffee too but the mug always appears in a very surrealistic way
