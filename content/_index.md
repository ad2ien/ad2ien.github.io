Hello ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack developer with backend affinities and agile management, devops and continuous integration skills.

I'm in my early forties and based in the south west of France near Toulouse but I'm always up for a trip from time to time.

I'm available for your web projects, especially if it involves open source coding ðŸ˜‡
